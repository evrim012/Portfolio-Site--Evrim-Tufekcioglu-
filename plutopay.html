          <p>Current online banking apps do not offer a
            wallet for Crypto currencies. Fintechs does not
            support web 3.0 infrastructure for future
            payment systems.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="">

          Our objective is to understand the user and
          implement their needs to have an app that
          would sufficiently provide a smooth user
          experience.
          We have conducted user surveys followed by
          user interviews to understand their
          needs and expectations. Once the app is
          created we will analyse the analytics to
          investigate further changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Frameworks & Early Wireframes
        </h3>
        <img src="img/plutopay/Card Research results.png" alt="">
        <p>After creating wireframes I have made paper
          and pen sketches to create
          early wireframes. These wireframes were
          then made to mid-fidelity on Adobe XD for
          further user testing</p>

        <h3>More User Testing</h3>
        <p>
          My goal is to cross-check results from card
          research and analyse how clear the app is. I
          made sure that the site map is on track and
          adjust it with findings. Scaling the usability of
          the app and making changes accordingly. All
          tests were moderated in person and were done
          online.

        <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
        <img src="img/plutopay/rainbowchart.svg" alt="">
        <p>After using Jakob Nielsen’s four-step rating
          scale it is clear that these major errors should
          be fixed. It appears that users look for their
          statements under accounts. Users also had
          difficulties swapping the card and making card
          information visible.</p>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Most important steps we took:</h4>
          <ul>Add statements under accounts.</ul>
          <ul>Swiping and clicking on the card name will
            swap cardsç</ul>
          <ul>Clicking on a card will show/hide card
            information.</ul>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>Additional steps to take:</h4>
          <ul>Add the last transaction on the home page
            and remove the chart.</ul>
          <ul>Adjustable dashboard menu to allow the user
            to see what is important.</ul>
          <ul>Smaller buttons can be tested to see UI related
            benefits.</ul>
          <ul>Deposit option could also be added to the
            accounts section next to the initial account</ul>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h4>To Conclude:</h4>
          <p>Overall users think that the app is easy to use
            and felt familiar with. Users easily locate their
            cards however some had difficulties finding
            details or swapping between them. Users
            expected more information on the dashboard
            page and some changes will be done
            accordingly. The most difficult task was to find
            statements which urgent actions will be taken
            regarding that. </p>
